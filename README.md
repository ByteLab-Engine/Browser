</div>

### Features:

- **Modern UI:** With a UI built on React, it is easy to customize ByteLab Browser and add new features.

- **Chromium under the hood:** Electron is based on Chromium, which allows ByteLab browser to use features like Chrome Dev Tools and support all websites.

- **Chrome Extensions:** ByteLab browser supports many Chrome extensions with the ability to download from the Chrome Web Store `*(WIP)`

- `And more, like tab groups, settings, a bookmarks bar, find in page, search history, download page ... `

### Why Electron? 

Many web browsers are built on Chromium. Chromium is a powerful web engine, but it is complex and hard to work on.

Using a framework like Electron allows us to make an easy-to-develop and customize web browser that has the power of Chromium.

Performance is also as fast or faster than Chromium based web browsers thanks to Electron's low overhead.
